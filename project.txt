The project should be done in pairs.
The following topics are available for selection (please choose one of them):

1) Implementation of convolutional neural network in Keras and analysis of its performance on selected
images.

2) Q-learning algorithm with a neural network (implemented in Keras) as a representation of the
Q-function.

3) A variational autoencoder that generates images basing on the MNIST dataset.

For the selected topic, provide a program and write a short report, analyzing the obtained results.
